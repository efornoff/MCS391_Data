1109946117469417472,2019-03-24 22:32:30,2440,756,"We are all presumed innocent under our constitution whether you are President or any other citizen. Prosecutors don‚Äôt exonerate folks because that‚Äôs not their job‚Äîthey either prosecute or they don‚Äôt. When they don‚Äôt, no other exoneration is needed-we are innocent under our laws."
1109945019685916673,2019-03-24 22:28:09,179,41,Attorney General Barr &amp; Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein ‚Äúhave concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction of justice offense.‚Äù An important finding from DOJ today.
1109943931033341953,2019-03-24 22:23:49,4695,1411,"On the charge of obstruction of justice, Bob Mueller‚Äôs report ‚Äúdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime‚Äù. That‚Äôs an important finding because that is what prosecutors do‚Äîthey prosecute, they do not exonerate. Why? Because we all enjoy the presumption of innocence."
1109942916439511041,2019-03-24 22:19:47,3722,350,Bob Mueller ‚Äúdid not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.‚Äù Complete exoneration by one of the prosecutors with the most integrity and experience in America.

989264140589027328,2018-04-25 22:05:25,14,0,@PoliticalStile My criticism of Jim is based on his performance on the HRC email probe. No right to have a presser to announce a prosecutorial decision--that is the job of the AG or the DAG. I respect Jim but he was wrong &amp; he would have fired any of us who did something like that on his watch.

985556893845385217,2018-04-15 16:34:08,290,78,I think it‚Äôs unfortunately obvious that Jim Comey began to believe his own press clippings. It's the biggest danger in public life.

985551858797293568,2018-04-15 16:14:08,217,65,There's a rule at Justice that 60 days before an election you do nothing about somebody who is going to be on the ballot. Comey did it 11 days before. He's the leader? Where was the deputy attorney general to stop him?
985549835741945857,2018-04-15 16:06:06,983,215,"What he's proving in his interview is that the president may have been right to fire him.  Don't agree with how it was done, but, in the interview Jim Comey is acknowledging that he took into account politics in making investigative decisions.  And that breaks all the rules."

It is so depressing as somebody who spent seven years in the Justice Department trying to make sure it worked the right way.

He would have fired me on the spot. He is guilty of doing that himself-Wow"
